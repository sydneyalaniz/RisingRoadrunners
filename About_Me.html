<p style="font-size: 140%;"> My name is Sydney! This a platform I created when I was running for Spirit of the Roadrunner for the University of Texas in San Antonio. This is a project to help disadvantage youth come to our university. I am very passionate about this topic since I came from the disadvantage background. I wrote this blog to show awareness. I am not a Computer Science major. I am a Neuroscience major that has hobbies! </p>
