<p style="font-size: 140%;"> My name is Sydney! I ran for Spirit of the Roadrunner at the University of Texas in San Antonio. I create this platform to support future roadrunners. This is a project to help disadvantaged youth come to our university. I am very
passionate about this topic since I come from a disadvantaged background. I wrote this blog to show awareness. I am not
a Computer Science major. I am a Neuroscience major who has hobbies!</p>
