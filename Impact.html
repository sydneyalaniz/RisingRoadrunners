<p style="font-size: 140%;"> Implementing a peer mentorship program for underprivileged students to succeed at our university would allow our
    community to foster an inclusive and diverse campus. It would allow our community to become more empathetic and give
    these disadvantage individuals a chance to succeed at out university. It would also influence a wide range of
    backgrounds and perspectives to be represented in the student body. These students would give our community a
    beautiful, unique, and vibrant atmosphere. It would allow these students to feel seen and heard in our community.
