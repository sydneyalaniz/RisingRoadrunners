<p style="font-size: 140%;"> We want to represent our community and its values. The mentorship program would promote academic success, campus
    resources, and inclusive and diverse programs. This program would encourage underprivileged students to feel it is
    possible to become a roadrunner. I created this blog to promote awareness that there are underprivileged students
    just like me that believe that they are not able to go to a university like this one. </p>
